## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Review the Figma file to catalog frames, typography, color tokens, spacing, and required assets.
- [x] 1.2 Scaffold a Next.js (latest LTS) App Router project with TypeScript, configure global styles, fonts, metadata, and design tokens.
- [x] 1.3 Build shared UI components (navigation, footer, buttons, cards, badges, pagination, newsletter/contact forms, sidebars) to match Figma.
- [x] 1.4 Implement all pages/routes shown in Figma: landing, blog listing, blog post detail, category/tag filtered views, and any community/contact sections.
- [x] 1.5 Introduce a content data model (e.g., structured JSON/MD) for posts/categories/tags to render listings, detail pages, and related content blocks.
- [x] 1.6 Apply responsive layouts, hover/focus states, and interactive behaviors (nav menu, filters, forms) consistent with the Figma design across breakpoints.
- [x] 1.7 Validate design fidelity against Figma on desktop/mobile and run project checks (lint/build) to ensure readiness.
