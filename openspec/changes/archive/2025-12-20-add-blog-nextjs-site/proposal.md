## Why
The project needs a full blog frontend built with the latest LTS version of Next.js that faithfully matches the provided Figma design for all screens.

## What Changes
- Scaffold a Next.js (latest LTS) App Router project with TypeScript, global styles, fonts, and shared UI primitives that mirror the Figma design tokens.
- Implement every page and section shown in the Figma file (landing, blog listing, post detail, categories/tags, community/contact/newsletter blocks) with data-driven components.
- Apply responsive behavior, interactions, and accessibility so the built site renders like the Figma across desktop and mobile breakpoints.

## Impact
- Affected specs: blog-ui
- Affected code: app/, components/, lib/, public/ assets, global styles, configuration files
